 solutions for the given task - a basic and an advanced. I have implemented the bacic one, which contains the essentials for the required setup to function. The advanced proposes what can be improved, scaled and automated with additional resources.


## Basic solution (implemented)

## Advanced solution (proposal)

### Technical overview

My Solution consists of the following elements:
- Cloudflare entry point
  - Hides the HA proxy IP address
  - DDoS protection
  - Web app firewall
- Caching CDN
- HA proxy
- GitLab app Docker containers
  - Hosts only the app, no DB, user files, logs, etc.
  - nginx
  - Straightforward deployment of app updates
  - Easy to lock package version dependencies
  - Session data is kept on the DB or file storage
- PostgreSQL / MySQL DB cluster
- File storage
  - Keeps the user files from the app, logs
  - Stores container images
- Redis cluster
- Logic monitor collector
- McAffee EPO
- Salt Master
  - Keeps the states for the different roles:
    - HA proxy
    - Container hosts
    - Jumpbox
    - â€¦
  - States are stored in a GIT repo on the file server
- Jumpbox
  - 2FA
  - The infrastructure is not visible from the outside world

Notes:
1. Preferred OS is RHEL 7.
2. Only the JB and HA proxy have public IP addresses. JB has only port 22 opened, HA has 443.
3. Patching is done every other week. If there is a testing environments, pathing in testing is done a week ahead of production. Version lock or a private yum repo can be used to enforce the same packages version for both testing and prod.
4. Scaling can be automated with LM measuring the load of the servers and issuing API calls to power up additional instances of app containers and adding them to the HA proxy.
5. Separate users for critical system processes - postgres, www-data, etc.
